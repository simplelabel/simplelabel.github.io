                <p>We all have these little boxes in our pockets called phones. Yours likely has the contact information for hundreds of people that you could contact any time you wanted. Many of those people are people you really care about and want to have a good relationship with. However, you probably do not contact them nearly as often as you would like despite having the ability to at any moment.</p>
                <p>You have the ability, you have the motivation, but what you are often missing is the prompt. At the most basic level that is what recall is. It is the prompt to call your mother, your friend from college, or that old work buddy that you have not talked to since you moved.</p>
                <p>What we have learned is that most people, including us, are not always good at friendship. Our lives are busy and it is so easy to push off checking in with the people we value. Another thing we learned though is that it does not take much to make those people feel valued and important. Routinely reaching out to them shows them you care and can significantly strengthen the connection you have with them. Especially extended over years it can have a transformational effect.</p>
                <p>This current version of the reCall app is focused on that prompt part. As we build up this tool we will add more features to help our customers improve their relational skills through tools and learning.</p>
                <p>We want your life to be filled with many rich relationships to support and encourage you as you face the challenges of life.</p>
